# Robot_Onslaught
Killer robots survival game created using Java.

In this game, the player has to survive against an onslaught of killer robots. The player has a bat and can attack the robots adjacent to the player. If the player attacks a robot, the robot loses one health and is pushed back one space in the direction it was attacked. If the robot is thrown into a wall, it takes lethal damage and is destroyed. The robots move in a random direction every turn. There can be multiple robots stacked in the same location and that is represented by a single digit number. A singular robot is represented by the upper case letter 'R' and a robot with only 1 health left is represented by the lower case letter 'r'. The player is represented by the at symbol, '@'. The user can move the player by using the U (for up), D (for down), L (for left), or R (for right) keys on the keyboard. The player can also stand still by just hitting enter. The player can attack robots that are adjacent to them by moving in the direction of the robot. When doing so, the robot will get attacked and the player will not move to a new location. To win the game, the player must destroy all the robots in the arena. If at any point in the game a robot occupies the same space as the player, then the player loses. The user may also quit the game at any point by entering the Q (for quit) key on the keyboard.
